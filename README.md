AS3 3D Graphics Engine

This is my (In-development) Actionscript 3.0 3D library.
It attempts to wrap Stage3D cleanly and concisely in an efficient, easy-to-use, and most importantly, NO-NONSENSE manner.

Current features:
-----------------
- Binary STL parsing
- Stage3D context manager
- Mesh management system
- Resource management protocall
- Material/Mesh rendering framework

In-Development features:
------------------------
- ASSL: Abstract shader synthesis language
- Dynamic model transform system

Planned features:
-----------------
- Several model formats
- Caching resource management system
- Multi-pass dynamic rendering
- Scene and camera control
- Hierarchal display list

Please feel free to use however, although a credit would be nice.
